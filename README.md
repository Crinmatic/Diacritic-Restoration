### The Problem:  
Yoruba or more specifically "√àd√® Yor√πb√°" is a major language, spoken by the indigenous people of the **Yoruba** tribe in Nigeria (more than **45 million** people globally).  

**The significance of solving this problem is evidenced by this analysis below:**  
‚ÄúYoruba is a tonal language and Diacritics are used to mark the tone of a vowel. The dot accent or alternatively the vertical line below, are used to mark open variants of vowels, namely ·∫π and ·ªç for […õ] and […î]; or below the s which transcribes the [ É], a post-alveolar consonant like 'sh' in English.‚Äù  
  
Given below are Yoruba vowel classification:  
```
a  =>  (√° √† ƒÅ)  
e => (√© √® ƒì ·∫π/eÃ© ·∫πÃÅ/√©Ã© ·∫πÃÄ/√®Ã© ·∫πÃÑ/ƒìÃ©  
i =>  (√≠ √¨ ƒ´)  
o =>  (√≥ √≤ ≈ç ·ªç/oÃ© ·ªçÃÅ/√≥Ã© ·ªçÃÄ/√≤Ã© ·ªçÃÑ/≈çÃ©)  
s  => (·π£ s)  
u =>  (√∫ √π ≈´)
```
  
Using these letters interchangeably, gives different meanings to words as they are pronounced differently.  
For example :  
```
A) oro  = or√≥  
As in ‚Äúoh-row‚Äù 		(or√≥ is ‚Äústing‚Äù when translated to English)  
  
B)oro  =  ·ªçÃÄr·ªçÃÄ  
As in ‚Äúaw-raw‚Äù 		(·ªçÃÄr·ªçÃÄ is ‚Äútext‚Äù or "word" when translated to English)   

C)	 ojo  = √≤j√≤  
As in ‚Äúoh-joe‚Äù 		(√≤j√≤ is ‚Äúrain‚Äù when translated to English)  

D)	ojo  =  ·ªçj·ªçÃÅ  
As in ‚Äúor-jaw‚Äù		   (·ªçj·ªçÃÅ is ‚Äúday‚Äù when translated to English)  
```

It's awesome right?  

Unfortunately, there's a problem. Words might be easy to pronounce (maybe not so much for beginners), but when it comes to writing or typing "Yoruba" text, we often disregard the "TONE MARKS", leading to the following:  
  
1) We end up fumbling the tone marks for each words, we intend on typing (even if we know how to pronounce it well)  
2) Some people just get lazy when putting the "TONE MARKS" because it takes quite a while for them to transcribe plain words and add the "TONE MARKS".  

  
### The Solution:

> Being Yor√πb√°, working on this project was a thing of delight for I and Oluwaseun Alagbe, and definitely an avenue to uplift our culture. üåª


> What we've built here is an A.I. (Natural Language Processing [NLP]) model which utilizes Artificial Neural Networks ü§ñ, to learn patterns in use for Diacritical (tonal) marks/"√Äm√¨ oh√πn", in thousands of Yor√πb√° words, which is possible thanks to the abundant availability of Yor√πb√° text data, that we mined from open-source Yor√πb√° literary texts i.e. Books, News articles, etc.


> This model when deployed, would go a long way in aiding proper communication in our mother tongue. ‚úçüèæ
