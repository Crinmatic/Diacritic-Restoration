– The Problem: 
Yoruba or more specifically "Èdè Yorùbá" is a major spoken language, indigenous to the Yoruba tribe in Nigeria, spoken by more than 45 million people globally. 

The significance of solving this problem is evidenced by this analysis below 👇🏽
“Yoruba is a tonal language. The diacritics are used to mark the tone of a vowel. The dot accent below is also used, alternatively the vertical line below, to mark open variants of vowels, namely ẹ and ọ for [ɛ] and [ɔ]; or below the s to transcribe the [ʃ], a postalveolar consonant like sh in English.”

Given below are the Yoruba  vowels classification:
a  =>  (á à ā) 
e => (é è ē ẹ/e̩ ẹ́/é̩ ẹ̀/è̩ ẹ̄/ē̩
i =>  (í ì ī) 
o =>  (ó ò ō ọ/o̩ ọ́/ó̩ ọ̀/ò̩ ọ̄/ō̩)
s  => (ṣ s)
u =>  (ú ù ū)

Using these letters interchangeably give different meanings to words as they are pronounced differently.
For example :
A) oro  = oró
As in “oh-row” 		(oró is “sting” when translated to English)

B)oro  =  ọ̀rọ̀
As in “aw-raw” 		(ọ̀rọ̀ is “text” or "word" when translated to English) 

C)	 ojo  = òjò
As in “oh-joe” 		(òjò is “rain” when translated to English)

D)	ojo  =  ọjọ́
As in “or-jaw”		   (ọjọ́ is “day” when translated to English)

It's awesome right?

Unfortunately, there's a problem, and this might be easy to pronounce (although not so much for the beginners), but when it comes to writing or typing "Yoruba" texts, we often disregard the "TONE MARKS" and this is why.

1 - We don't know the appropriate tone mark for each word (even if we know how to pronounce it)

2 - Some people just get lazy when putting the "TONE MARKS" because it takes quite a while for them to process the tones and add the "TONE MARKS".
