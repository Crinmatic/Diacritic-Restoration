The Ìjèṣà (person) does not need matches; it is from the home that the scion of Ọwa takes burning faggots to the farm.
Said to assert self-sufficiency, that one does not need the aid of other people. Before the white man came with his matches people knew how to make fire. This is obviously a proverb coined in Iléṣà, home of the Ìjèṣà, whose king is the Ọwá. The nídìí (ní ìdí) translates literally as “have a reason for,” but it is a play on the English “need.”
