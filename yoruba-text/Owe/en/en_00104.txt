An elder is not present at a market and permit a child's head to rest askew.
Elders must not permit untowards happenings in their presence. Babies are carried on their mothers' backs. When they fall asleep their heads may loll crookedly. Since the mothers cannot see behind them, responsible people are required to call their attention to the babies' crooked postures.
