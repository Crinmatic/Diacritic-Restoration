Which among the leaves of the locust-bean tree is adequate to receive corn-loaf?
Certain feats are beyond certain people; people should not presume to do things beyond their capabilities. Corn-loaves are cooked wrapped in large leaves, much larger than the leaves of the locustbean tree, which are inadequate for the purpose. The proverb plays on gbà (to receive) and the last end of ìrúgbàá (gbà á), which means “receive it,” or “accommodate it.”
