One boasts only about things proper to boast about; whoever heard of the boast, “By this time yesterday I had given my parent-in-law the beating of his life.”?
One should always confine one's actions to those that are proper and becoming. A tag to the proverb goes: Bó bá yẹ ẹ́, tẹni tí ńfà á ńkọ́? (Even if it does, what about the person pulling it?)
