If you have a great deal of medicine and you are false, it will not work; one's head works better than any herb; one's destiny is far more effective than any medicine.
One's evil intentions make one's medicine ineffective; one's best hope lies in one's head and one's destiny. For the Yoruba, orí (literally, “head”) is the guardian of one's destiny.
