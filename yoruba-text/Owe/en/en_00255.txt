If I die on account of a farm, I will lay my case before the hut; if I die on account of bananas, I will lay my case before the river; if I die on account of the famous woman with facial scarification, I will lay my case before my head.
Were I to die for a woman, the forces ordering my fortune would know why. This is apparently the plaint of a man besotted by his attraction to a woman.
