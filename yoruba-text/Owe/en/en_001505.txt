Whoever gathers palm fruits in desperation will gather unripe ones; whoever states his or her case in desperation will be adjudged at fault by the king; whoever digs a hole in desperation will dig out an iguana lizard.
Nothing turns out well if done in desperation. Easy does it. The digging of holes in this case would normally be for the purpose of finding something edible, a crab, for instance. An iguana lizard is not only unsuitable as food, it is also considered dangerous.
