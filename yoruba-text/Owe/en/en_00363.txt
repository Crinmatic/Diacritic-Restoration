When the clay statue hankers for disgrace it asks to be placed in the rain.
A person who so forgets himself/herself and overreaches himself/herself will wind up in disgrace. Ṣ"ìgìdì is a clay image one makes of one's enemy and endows by means of incantations with the power to harm the enemy in his/her dream. Although thus endowed with supernatural powers, if it is placed in the rain it will crumble.
