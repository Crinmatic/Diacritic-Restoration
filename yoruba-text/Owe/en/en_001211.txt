A child says that people do eat vultures, and its father says people do not; the child says someone did eat a vulture in its presence; its father asks, who? The child says the person is dead.
The youth who attempts to challenge the wisdom of the elders will find himself tripped by his own mouth. The phrase kò sí in Yoruba means “there is none” or “there is not . . .,” and when attached predicatively to a person it is a euphemism that the person is dead. In this case the statement that the person died does double duty in that it also literally supports the father's assertion.
