Wherever the yọ̀nmọ̀ntì (food made from benniseed) seller falls, there she has sold all her wares.
It makes no sense to dwell on unrecoverable disasters. Yọ̀nmọ̀ntí is a commodity that cannot be scooped up after it has spilled on the ground. The seller taking some to the market hopes to sell it all, but if she falls along the way and spill it, she is left with nothing to sell, just as though she has sold it all.
