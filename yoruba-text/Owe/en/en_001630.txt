Pluck a fig leaf and be attacked by soldier-ants; put a leaf in your mouth and be attacked by the deaf.
Whoever takes unnecessary risks will very likely face dangerous consequences. Fig leaves are usually infested with soldier-ants, and the deaf are supposed to be insulted by anyone who places a leaf in his/her mouth.
