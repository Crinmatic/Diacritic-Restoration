The water lettuce always winds up on the surface of the water; the water-lily always wings up on the surface of the stream.
Just as those plants remain on top of their habitats, so one will remain triumphant over one's adversaries. Ojú oró is Pistia Stratiotes (Arcideae); and Òṣíbàtà is Nymphaea Lotus. (Abraham 463; 491.)
