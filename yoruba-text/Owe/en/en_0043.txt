One does not conclude for the person who says “Ẹ̀ẹ́dẹ́ . . .”
Never presume to know what someone else intends to say. In Yorùbá numeration “ẹ̀ẹ́dẹ́ . . .” indicates a certain amount (or figure) “less than ...”; “ẹ̀ẹ́dógún,” for instance, is fifteen (five less than twenty), while “ẹ̀ẹ́dẹ́gbẹ̀rin” is seven hundred (one hundred less than eight hundred.).
