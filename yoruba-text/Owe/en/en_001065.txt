It is on account of people that one has a right hand; one could do with only a left hand otherwise.
One must learn the grace that is appropriate for decent company. People eat with the right hand and therefore use the left hand for dirty jobs. The left hand has consequently come to be associated with filthiness, disrespect, and so forth. One would not, for example, offer something with the left hand to a person one respects.
