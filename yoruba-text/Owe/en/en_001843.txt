A child wakes from sleep and says in code, “Bean fritters two-by-two.” Had the others been taking them thus before he woke would any have been left?
Never misuse what those before you made available to you by their wise husbandry. The child's real meaning is “Àkàrà méjì-méjì” (Bean fritters two at a time), and the rejoinder is, “Wọn ti ḿmú bẹ́ẹ̀ kó tó jí ì bá bá nílẹ̀?” (Had people been taking grabbing them like that, would he have found any left?). The child is using the sort of scrambled speech known as ẹnà.
