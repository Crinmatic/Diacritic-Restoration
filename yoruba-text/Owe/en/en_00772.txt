The Ààrẹ summons you and you consult the oracle; what if the oracle says all will be well and the Ààrẹ decrees otherwise?
There is no point in attempting to restrict the action of an absolute authority. The proverb came into being in the days of Kurunmí the Ààrẹ (military ruler) of Ìjaye in the 1820s. He was so powerful and so feared that people believed that even oracles could not deflect him from any course he chose to follow. See also, Àgbàlagbà ti ò kí Ààrẹ . . .
