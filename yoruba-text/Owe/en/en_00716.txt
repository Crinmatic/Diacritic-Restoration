Neglect to say, “Here is your's” is what incites the earth's anger.
Failure to take account of people's possible influence on one's affairs incites their anger. As long as one assumes humility, people will let one be. This belief is reflected in the practice of paying homage to ayé (meaning literally “the world,” but in fact the people of the world) before embarking on any venture; the gesture, people believe, will safeguard their venture from ill will.
