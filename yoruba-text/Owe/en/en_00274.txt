Even if the goddess Ọya sings in heaven and the god Ṣango sings on earth, matters cannot be so bad for the father that he will say it is all up to his dead child in heaven.
Even in suffering one should never disgrace oneself. The proverb refers to the Yoruba belief that the dead have the power to protect their living survivors. Normally, though, the living look to the spirits of dead elders for such protection, never to the spirits of their dead children.
