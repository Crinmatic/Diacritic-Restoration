The cooking pot must never harbor a grudge to the same extent that the sieve does; if the pot does so, the corn-meal trader will have nothing to sell.
The more power one has, the more one should exercise restraint. In a sense both the pot that cooks the corn-meal (from the starch) and the strainer used to separate the starch from the eèrí (bran) are containers. But while the pot holds the material put into it, the strainer permits it to escape. That action is here represented as a manifestation of anger. If the pot were to behave like the strainer there would be no food left.
