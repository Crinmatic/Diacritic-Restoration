Keep your red blood inside and spit out clear saliva.
Never show your hand to your enemy; let not your words or action reveal your intentions to your enemy. This proverb is sometimes used as a criticism of deceitful people who appear to be friends but are full of ill will: Ọmọ aráyé fẹ̀jẹ̀ sínú tutọ́ funfun jáde (Human beings keep their blood inside and spit out clear saliva).
