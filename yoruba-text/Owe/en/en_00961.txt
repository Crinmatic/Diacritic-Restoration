Whoever announces that the legs of the masquerader are showing is the one who goes in search of a needle.
Some sights the eyes must not acknowledge seeing. Compare Bí ojú bá rí, ẹnu a dákẹ́and Ẹní bá ríkun nímú ọba... It is taboo for any part of a masquerader's body to show. If one notices any part showing, one would be wise to keep the fact to oneself.
