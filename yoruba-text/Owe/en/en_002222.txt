You pray to live as long as Olúàṣo, but can you endure the trials of Olúàṣo?
Whoever wishes for the sort of glory another person enjoys must also be willing to endure whatever tribulations the person has endured. Olúàṣo was a king (Aláàfin) of Ọ̀yọ́ reputed to have lived for 320 years and to have sired 1,460 children (Johnson 158).
