It is for the person who sweeps the floor that the floor is clean.
Those who exert themselves are the ones who reap rewards. The expression Ilẹ̀-ẹ́ mọ́ means both “the floor is clean” and “morning has broken.” The proverb thus also carries the suggestion that a new day, supposedly an auspicious day, dawns for those who sweep the floor, especially since sweeping is one of the first orders of duty for conscientious housekeepers every morning.
