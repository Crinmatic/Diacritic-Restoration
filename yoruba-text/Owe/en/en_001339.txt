Saare always goes too far in his description of a leopard.
An immoderate display of knowledge soon backfires. The story behind the proverb is of a boy, Sàar;ẹ who ran home panting because he had seen a leopard in the forest. Grateful that the animal did not kill his son, the father killed a cock as a sacrifice. The boy went on to describe how huge the animal was, and the father, even more thankful, killed a he-goat for sacrifice. Then the son spoke of how the animal went from okro plant to okro plant to eat the fruits. The father knew, of course, that only antelopes ate okro, and he scolded the son for not killing the game and bringing it home.
