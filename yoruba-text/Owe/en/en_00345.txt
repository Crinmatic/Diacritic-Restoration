“Accept imputation of imbecility,” “I will accept no imputation of imbecility” is the explanation for market noise.
One may have no means of avoiding insult from others, but it is always in one's power to reject insults. The expression “Gba wèrè,” translated as “Accept imbecility,” means “acquiesce in being treated like an imbecile.” The back-and-forth haggling during market transactions is here seen as each bargainer proposing terms to the interlocutor, who would be an imbecile to accept them.
