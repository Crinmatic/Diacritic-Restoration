The giant bush rat turns its back at the place where he has a quarrel; after getting to the market it clamps its hands on its head.
The moment and the place to act are when and where the matter is taking place, not when all is over and everybody has dispersed. The fight here refers to the circumstances in which the bush rat is captured. After hunters kill a giant bush rat they gut it and affix it to a stake, the stake running the length of its body, through the head, and, finally, through the fore-limbs which are clasped together above the rodent's head. A common gesture people visited by misfortune use is clamping their head in their hands.
