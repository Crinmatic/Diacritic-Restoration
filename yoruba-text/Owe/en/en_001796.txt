Purveyor of general disaster, who carries a gángan drum into town.
Apostrophe addressed to trouble makers. Apart from its noisiness, it is not clear why the introduction of a gángan drum (the talking drum) into town would be disasterous. A suggestion is that the bearer carries the drum on his head to signal sorrow.
