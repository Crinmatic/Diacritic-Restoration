It is a calabash that understands one's language that one describes as a measure.
One places one's confidence only in those of the same mind with one. Traders in such things as grains or flour use calabashes as measures, and they resort to dexterous tricks to control just how much of the commodity the measure will hold from transaction to transaction. A good measure responds to the owner's wishes.
