We recite someone's praise names, we intone his attributes, and a person says he does not know who died; we say, “He of the two hundred granaries, he whose yams are plentiful on the farm, he whose corn is abundant in the fields,” and the person asks, “Is the dead person a hunter, or a trader?”
A person for whom everything must be spelled out, a person who cannot make deductions from the most obvious hints, is daft indeed.
