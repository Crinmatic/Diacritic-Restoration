When will (or how can) Maku avoid the danger of dying? Maku does not know the mysteries of the cult yet he joins in its vows; Maku does not know how to swim and yet he jumps into the river.
A person who will not cooperate in safeguarding himself/herself frustrates the efforts of others. The name Mákùú (má kùú) means “Do not die.”
