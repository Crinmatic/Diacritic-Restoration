“This is no great loss; this is no great loss;” the muslim's cap dwindles to almost nothing.
If one keeps dispensing of one's property only a little at a time, soon little will be left. The reference is to the skull cap associated with muslims.

His response each time is that he can afford to give up just a little bit.
