One does not smear blood (from a woman's deflowering) on a Muslim charm; a de-virgined woman does not give birth to a “female” child.
One must not do the forbidden if one does not expect trouble. Muslims are understandably squeamish about blood from the deflowering of a woman. Alákoto here refers to a promiscuous woman, whose child one cannot expect to be well behaved. A “female” child is well behaved, while a “male” child is not.
