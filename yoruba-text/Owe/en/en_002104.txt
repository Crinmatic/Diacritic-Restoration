How much distance exists between the nose and the mouth? How much distance exists between Làǹlátẹ̀ and Èrúwà?
One should not make a fuss over running an errand that is not a great imposition. Làǹlátẹ̀ and Èrúwà are neighboring villages in the Ìbàdàn orbit. The proverb suggests they are as close as the mouth is to the nose, and a person sent on an errand from one to the other should not complain.
