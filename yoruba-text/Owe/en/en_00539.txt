The fish-eagle cannot catch the kite flying on high; it can only catch Bamidele.
Said of people who will confront only weaklings rather than people who match them in strength. Bámidélé is a male name. The proverb is probably based on the play between ọ̀ṣín, the name for the vulturine fish-eagle, and Ọṣìn, a male name that is sometimes used as a designation for a king. Bámidélé (which means “Come home with me”) indicates that the possible prey is one that is readily at hand.
