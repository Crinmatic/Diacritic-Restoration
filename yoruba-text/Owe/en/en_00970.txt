It is someone who knows the duiker intimately who can recite its praise, “spindle-legged duiker.”
Only those deeply involved in a profession are versed in its jargon. It is one of the expectations of the hunting profession that hunters know the praises of the animals they encounter in their trade. The cited phrase comes from the hunters' praise for the duiker. See Babalọla: 88-91; Abraham: 199.
