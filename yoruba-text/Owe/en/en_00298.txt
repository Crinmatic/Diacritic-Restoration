A shameless person deserves to have only one eye, that one as large as a horse's.
Human endowments are wasted on graceless people. The proverb plays on ìtìjú, literally “the pushing at the eyes,” which is the Yoruba word for shame. A person who is insensitive to “the pushing at the eyes” certainly can do without a second eye, and the one he or she does have can be as large as possible, since it will be insensitive to pushing, and the disfigurement would mark the person as grotesque while having no effect on him or her.
