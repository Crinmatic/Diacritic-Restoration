A cat's back never touches the ground.
One's opponent in a fight will never succeed in throwing one. This is a reference to the cat's ability to always right itself and land on its feet however much one tries to drop it on its back. The saying is most often used by wrestlers as an incantation to prevent their opponents from throwing them.
