To Tortoise belongs the outward trip; to his father-in-law belongs the return.
The person in the right in a dispute, if he/she is too vindictive, quickly becomes the one in the wrong. The proverb is based on a folktale in which Tortoise stole yams from the farm of its father-in-law. The latter caught Tortoise and tied it up by the path, where people going to their farms saw it and justified the father-in-law. When on their return in the evening they saw Tortoise still tied up, however, people began to scold the father-in-law for the excessive punishment, especially considering its relationship to Tortoise.
