People are scheming to shake an imbecile from their company, and he asks that they wait for him on reaching the bank of the river.
If people are seeking ways of getting rid of a person, that person should not lay down his conditions for remaining with them. Corcchorus Olitorius (Jew's Mallow) (Tiliaceae). See Abraham, 533.
