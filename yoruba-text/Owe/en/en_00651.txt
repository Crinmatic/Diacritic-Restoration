We kneel and sacrifice a ram, and the bàtá drummer shows reluctance to take his leave. Does he wish to inherit a wife?
One should always know when to take one's leave. See A sìnkú tán . . . The kneeling and sacrificing described here are the final activities in funeral obsequies. Thereafter the immediate survivors of the deceased turn to practical matters, like distributing the dead man's wives among themselves for support. Hired drummers are certainly not welcome in such matters. The greeting, ojú ò fẹ́rakù, meaning, literally, “the eyes do not “have not” miss“ed” one another,” is spoken on leave taking, but it suggests that the person departing is really still present in spirit.
