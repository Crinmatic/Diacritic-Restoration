The man who “claimed to have” killed six people during the Ọla war: people exclaimed in disbelief, “Ha, ha, ha!” He asked them to bring an ayò board, and he won six games. He said, if there were no witnesses for what happened in the secluded forest, aren't there witnesses for what happens in the house?
One may not believe what one was not witness to, but that which one sees one must believe; seeing is believing. The humor, even the wit, of the proverb resides more than in anything else, in the play on “pa,” which in the context of an ayò game means “to win,” but in the context of a war means “to kill.” The stalwart in question settles the argument about whether he could have killed six people in a war by winning six ayò games.
