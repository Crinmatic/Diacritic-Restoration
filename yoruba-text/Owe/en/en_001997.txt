If one does not act like a pig on the way to Ikòròdú one cannot act like Adégbọrọ̀at the king's market.
Before one can live in luxury, one must soil one's hands with work. Ìkòròdú is a town a few miles from Lagos (the reference is to a farm on the way to the town), while the name Adégbọrọ̀ means, “The crown(ed head) receives riches.”
