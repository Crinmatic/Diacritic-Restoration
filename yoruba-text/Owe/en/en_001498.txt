Whoever knows how to eat Akee Apple must know how to remove its deadly raphe.
One should be sure of one's capabilities before one attempts dangerous feats. Iá¹£in, Akee Apple, is a fruit whose fleshy part is eaten raw or cooked. Its raphe is deadly and must be carefully removed before the flesh is consumed. (See Abraham, 323.)
