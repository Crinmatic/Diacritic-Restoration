The owner of the yams makes yam pottage out of the yams; the person who eats the yam scrapings off the peels is shamed.
The parasite is shamed when the host finds a way to shut him out. The preparation of ẹ̀bẹ (or àṣáró) leaves no yam remnant on the peels for a parasite to take advantage of; roasting and later peeling yams on the other hand, for example, would leave something for such a parasite.)
