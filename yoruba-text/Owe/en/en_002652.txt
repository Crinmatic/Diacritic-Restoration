“The pounded yam is good and the stew is delicious” killed Akíndélé on his farm at Ìgbájọ́ “God, I will not give you some food to eat” is what killed the priest at Ìkiré.
Closed-fistedness and stinginess brings people nothing but misfortune. Presumably Akíndélé would not share the pounded yam and stew because they were delicious, and the priest kept all the things meant for sacrifice to the god for himself.
