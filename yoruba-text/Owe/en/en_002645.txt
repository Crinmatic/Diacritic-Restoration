The blemish of the yam is the blemish of the knife; whoever besmirches other people's names besmirches his/her own.
How one treats others reflects more on oneself than on the others. The idea is that if one peels a yam with a knife and streaks show on the yam, the flaw is the knife's, not the yam's.
