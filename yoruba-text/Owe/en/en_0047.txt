One helps to catch a chicken and scrapes one's knees; having laid one's hands on the chick will one not hand it over to the owner?
One should not be overzealous in helping others, especially when no benefit will accrue to one from the effort. In Yoruba usage one would not use personal pronouns to refer to animals, even though Yoruba pronouns are not differentiated by gender.
