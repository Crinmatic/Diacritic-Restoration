Woodpeckers in the forest say they can carve mortars, frogs in the stream say they can string beads, and awúrebe say they can weave cloth.
Misplaced self-confidence leads the creatures into empty boasts. The woodpecker's habit has some slight resemblance to the carving of mortars, the eggs of frogs have some slight resemblance to strung beads, and the action of awúrebe resembles weaving, but in each case the product is not quite what humans have in mind.
