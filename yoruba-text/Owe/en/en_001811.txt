Excessive cleverness turns one into a phantom; if there is too much magical charm it turns the owner into an imbecile; if a woman is too cunning her husband's clothes wind up ill-fitting.
People who are too cunning are headed for trouble; a man who married too cunning a woman is headed for trouble.
