His loincloth is being stripped from behind, yet he is stripping those of the people ahead of him.
Attacks on him do not stop him from belaboring his enemies. The proverb recalls the oríkì of Ògèdèm̀gbé, the 19th century Ìjèṣà warrior, which says, À ńlé e bọ̀ lẹ́hìn, ó ńlé ará iwájú lọ (He is being pursued from behind, and yet he is in pursuit of people in front.)
