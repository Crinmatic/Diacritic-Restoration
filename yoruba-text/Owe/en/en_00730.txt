Tortoise says that since the day it learned the trick of saying yes its neck has ceased to shrink.
One who says yes to every request avoids a great many arguments. See Ẹlẹ́dẹ̀ẹ́ ní ọjọ́ tí òún ti jágbọ́nọn hùn . . ., and Ẹrùu òo kì í wọni lọ́rùn. The explanation is that Tortoise one was in the company of more powerful animals. Whenever those animals had heavy loads to carry they sent for Tortoise, but the animal always refused to oblige, whereupon they gave it powerful blows on the head. At times, in order to avoid such blows Tortoise would carry the loads at the expense of its weak neck. Finally it learned to say “Yes” to every request but escape when the animals were not looking. The moral is that one may agree to every request, but one does not have to follow through.
