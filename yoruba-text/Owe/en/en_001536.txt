The same mouth with which the snail insults the god is the one on which it crawls to the god.
The person who insults a powerful person will in time eat his or her words before the person insulted. Snails are used as sacrifices to some gods. The suggestion is that the reason why snails crawl mouth down is because a snail once insulted a god.
