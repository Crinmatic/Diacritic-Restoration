One should not because of one's suffering try honing one's eyes on the ground.
Difficulties should not lead one to foolish behavior. The phrase “ojú pípọ́n” from which the proverbs in this series are formulated means “red eyes,” supposedly the sign of suffering. “Pọ́n” can mean both “to be red” and “to hone.” Hence the play in this proverb.
