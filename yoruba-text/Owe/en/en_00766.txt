It is in furtherance of one's own fortune that one calls the name Temidire.
Each person must advance his or her own interests. The name Tèmídire means “My affairs have prospered.” Although the name indicates that the bearer is the fortunate one, the person who calls the name says “My . . .,” thereby invoking good fortune on him/herself.
