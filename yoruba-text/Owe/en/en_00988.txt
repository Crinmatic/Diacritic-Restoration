“Hold my child for me so I may wiggle my buttocks”; if one cannot wiggle one's buttocks one should return the child to its mother.
One should not place oneself in difficulty in order to help others out of difficulty. When Yoruba women dance they like to wiggle their buttocks, a feat that is difficult when they have children strapped to their backs as is the custom.
