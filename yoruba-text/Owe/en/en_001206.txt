A small child never knows when kúròkúrò takes its leave.
Youth is a stranger to etiquette or protocol. “Kúrò” means “leave,” or “depart.” Kúrò-kúrò,” in accordance with Yorùbá word formation would thus mean “one who departs.” The idea here is that the child does not know the right time to leave a place.
