The dandy is the enemy of the town; it is the finicky person that the king kills.
The people of a town may envy a dandy; but it is the reckless person who comes to grief. The idea is that the dandy knows his place, even if he incites envy, whereas the finicky person who is afraid of death refuses to show respect for the king in the usual way-prostrating himself before the king-and loses his head therefore.
