It is ineptitude-in-setting-it-down that makes the wine a spoil for the eégún (i.e., that causes the wine to be spilled).
Ineptitude makes an impossible job of the easiest tasks. The Yoruba expression, “Eégún gbà á,” meaning literally, “Eégún (the incarnated spirit of the ancestors) has appropriated it,” is a way of saying, “It is lost to people.” Compare, Kélé gbé e, and Orò-ó gbé e.
