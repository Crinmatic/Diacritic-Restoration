A lazy person's illness is not soon over; the lazy person finds no way out and prepares a fire to warm his head.
A lazy person will use every excuse to avoid any obligation, and when he cannot avoid it, his fulfillment of it is always pitiable. The point of lighting a fire to warm his head is obscure. The other possibility, dáná ori (meaning “offer a feast of corn meal”) would suggest a laughable endeavor, since ori (ẹ̀kọ) is not a particularly popular meal. Another possibility, equally problematic, is dáná òrí (“make fire using shea butter as fuel,” or “make fire for shea butter)”.
