The person who takes one's wife cannot stop one's locust bean seeds from fermenting.
A person who injures one cannot stop one from pursuing one's destiny. Irú is the fermented condiment derived from the seeds of the locustbean tree. The suggestion seems to be that the man deprived of a wife can still cook his stew, since his irú can still ferment even in the absence of a wife (who would normally cook the stew).
